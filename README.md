Optimization for a Sturm-Liouville Problem with the Spectral Parameter in the Boundary Condition
User will input an array containing the parameters and also the functions r and q, the script
will then generate a critical point (f,p) and graph p over a hundred points between [0,1] as
well as generate the mass M[p]
